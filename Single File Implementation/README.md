# This Folder consists for the implemenation where there are data available in a single file
In single File implementation we are already given with the values of each node in a single file. Hence, we go on computing every state using the node data and graph data. We are given the states of each node and adjacency matrix of each node. We then calculate the Degree matrix and Laplacian matrix and use the average consensus formula for computation.
There are two approaches. One is using Discrete time and the other is using Continouous time. Look into the code for the implementation.
